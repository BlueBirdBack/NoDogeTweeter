**Note:** Elon Musk changed the Twitter logo back to its original design, making this extension unnecessary. However, you can still use this as an example of how to create a Chrome extension to modify website elements.

- Automatically detects the Doge logo on Twitter and replaces it with the original Twitter logo
- Preserves the original HTML structure
